# Netflix Clone

## Project Overview
**Netflix Clone** is a modern web application built with **React** that mimics the functionality of Netflix. Utilizing the **TMDB (The Movie Database) API**, this project allows users to browse, search, and view details about a wide variety of movies and TV shows. The application leverages React's state management, hooks (like `useEffect`), and component-based architecture to provide a responsive and interactive user experience.

## Key Features
- **Dynamic Movie & TV Show Listings**: Fetches and displays popular movies and TV shows from the TMDB API.
- **Search Functionality**: Users can search for specific titles using a dedicated search bar.
- **Responsive Design**: Built using CSS modules for a seamless experience across devices.
- **Detailed View**: Clicking on a movie or show opens a detailed view with additional information.
- **User Authentication**: (Optional) Implement user sign-up and login functionality.

## Technologies Used
- **React**: For building the user interface with reusable components.
- **TMDB API**: To fetch data about movies and TV shows.
- **Axios**: For making HTTP requests to the TMDB API.
- **CSS Modules**: For styling components in a modular way.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
